# Web API
This is an introductory overview of API. 
This project covers how API looks, runs and its most important features. 
Eventually, I will compare API to ASP.NET Core's other four project types. 

# Short Description
The API project type is an outlier of the other four ASP.NET Core project types.
Its main role is to communicate data to other projects and clients.
It simplifies getting information and allows teams to create multiple user interfaces,
such as a mobile application, that will communicate with the API through endpoints.
